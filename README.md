# Personality Based Friend Recommendation System


This project is a team project for major-project of final year CS-UG program. This repo highlights only the Front-end work which I was responsible for. It is an implementation of the idea of recommending connections on the basis of personality rather than just mutual connections on social media. The current emphasis is, however, not to build a recommendation system considering tens of factors but a prototype considering only a few factors like: types of posts user made on social media, areas of interest, age, and connections; which are of current interest for this project. 
Technologies used for frontend are: ***React.js, HTML, CSS***

There is also a test-backend server in Node.js with MongoDB database(temporary, for testing APIs) available in "nodebackendtemp" folder

Below is the working Front-end code. It shows a network of people and their profiles along with current friends(green) and recommendations(yellow). On clicking +/- (add/remove friends) new users will be added/removed from friend list, and Users can also post new content. In backend, our team is using Django and ML model to predict personality of user and recommendation scores(shown in tooltip on yellow nodes) of the new suggested connections.
